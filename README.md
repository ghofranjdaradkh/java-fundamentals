# lab 2 :
1. The first thing we deal with IntelliJ, and use Gradle with IntelliJ IDEA  -type java-library
2. create methods Rolling Dice,Contains Duplicates,Calculating Averages,and Arrays of Arrays.

3. then we take TDD 'Testing Development Driven' it's a methodology to test your application.
and deal with Arrange/Act/Assertions >> to test your code.
